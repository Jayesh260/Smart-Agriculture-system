# Smart-Agriculture-system
Agriculture is one of the largest and most critical sectors, providing food security and economic stability worldwide. However, it faces multiple challenges, including climate fluctuations, inefficient resource management, soil degradation, and plant diseases, all of which negatively impact crop productivity and sustainability. Traditional farming practices rely on experience-based decision-making, often failing to consider real-time environmental changes, weather conditions, and technological advancements. Farmers often lack access to data-driven final conclusions, leading to bad crop selection and have the improper fertilizer application or it get wasted by washed down by rain or water, and be insufficient to delay the disease. To address these critical issues, we propose an AI-driven Smart Agriculture System that leverages ML, DL, and NLP to enhance decision-making and increase agricultural efficiency.
Our system incorporates Random Forest (RF) models for crop and fertilizer recommendations, analysing soil properties, climate variations, historical agricultural data, and weather conditions to provide farmers with optimal strategies for cultivation. Furthermore, plant image-based disease detection is performed using ResNet9 that is based on deep learning model that ensuring early result and it identifies the disease of plant accurately, which in turn is crucial to prevent yield losses and minimizing the overuse of pesticides. The system integrates real-time weather APIs to adjust recommendations based on ongoing climate fluctuations, making farming decisions more adaptive and data-driven. A significant innovation in our system is the inclusion of an NLP-powered multilingual chatbot, which allows farmers to interact through text or speech in multiple languages, enhancing accessibility for rural and illiterate farmers. This chatbot connects with AI-driven models and external data sources to provide personalized, real-time recommendations on crop selection, fertilizer use, pest control, and weather conditions. The AI-powered Decision Support System (DSS) fosters precision farming, sustainability, and optimized resource utilization, closing the gap in traditional farming methods and significantly reducing the pit that is between modern technology. By providing scalable, adaptable, and real-time agricultural insights, this system aims to revolutionize global farming practices, making smart agriculture accessible to farmers of all scales, especially in resource-constrained regions.
